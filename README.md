# Title
Foreword

When the project was initially presented to us, we felt disoriented, uncertain about where to begin. The project seemed both simple and complex: simple in its concise and direct instruction, but complex due to the lack of foundational elements to build upon for a start.

In this project, we sourced our information from various avenues, such as articles, discussion forums, and similar projects. For its implementation, we utilized Visual Studio Code with the Copilot extension, GitHub, ChatGPT, and Google Colab.

Visual Studio Code was our primary tool for developing our models, aided by ChatGPT and Copilot. We shared our progress through a GitHub repository. Although the installation process was lengthy and fraught with errors, once operational, our productivity and efficiency significantly improved. The mere act of pushing the code allowed the other team member to easily pull it.

However, training our model on Visual Studio Code proved too slow, leading us to switch to Google Colab and opt for the T4 runtime type, which was considerably faster. We even subscribed to the paid version to further accelerate the process.

In Part 2: Process, we will detail all the steps of our work.
